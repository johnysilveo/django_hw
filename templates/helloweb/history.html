    <p class="mb-2">
      Founded during the early Hegemony expansion, Keats grew around Hyperion’s primary spaceport on the Equus
      continent. Named in honor of poet <em>John Keats</em>, the city blended frontier grit with high culture:
      landing pads beside amphitheaters; cargo mechs idling outside coffeehouses where pilgrims swapped Time Tombs rumors.
    </p>
    <p class="m-0">
      As the largest settlement on Hyperion, Keats hosted the Hegemony Consulate and the Governor-General’s offices,
      serving as a launch point for expeditions into the <strong>Sea of Grass</strong> and toward the enigmatic
      <strong>Time Tombs</strong>.
